# 📰 Updates

**2026.07.14** — Since the previously trained Mem-0 checkpoints were not backed up before our development machine was recycled, we have re-organized the training and now publicly release the retrained model weights:

- **M(1) tasks**: due to limited computational resources, all M1 tasks were trained jointly into a single multi-task `m1_mix` model. The complete model, the processed `m1_mix` dataset, training/inference configs, and all evaluation logs and videos are available at [qiuly/Mem-0-m1mix-RMBench](https://huggingface.co/qiuly/Mem-0-m1mix-RMBench) and [qiuly/Mem-0-m1mix-dataset-RMBench](https://huggingface.co/datasets/qiuly/Mem-0-m1mix-dataset-RMBench).
- **M(n) tasks**: per-task execution-module checkpoints for `battery_try`, `blocks_ranking_try`, `cover_blocks` and `press_button`, together with per-task normalization stats and evaluation results, are available at [qiuly/Mem-0-mn-RMBench](https://huggingface.co/qiuly/Mem-0-mn-RMBench).

Detailed evaluation results can be found in the Hugging Face model cards above.

# 🧑🏻‍💻 RMBench Usage

> This project is built upon [RoboTwin 2.0](https://github.com/robotwin-Platform/RoboTwin), and you can seamlessly transfer your policy code between the two projects.

## 1. Installation
First, prepare a conda environment.

```
conda create -n RMBench python=3.10 -y
conda activate RMBench
```

RMBench Repo: https://github.com/RoboTwin-Platform/RMBench

```
git clone https://github.com/RoboTwin-Platform/RMBench.git
```

Then, run `script/_install.sh` to install basic conda envs and CuRobo:

```
bash script/_install.sh
```

## 2. Download Assets
To download the assets, run the following command. If you encounter any rate-limit issues, please log in to your Hugging Face account by running `huggingface-cli login`:

```
bash script/_download_assets.sh
```

## 3. Download Data

Please run the following command to download all data.

```
bash script/_download_data.sh
```

<details>
<summary>If you need to collect the data (we actually recommend downloading it directly)</summary>

> In RMBench, we always use `demo_clean` setting.

Running the following command will first search for a random seed for the target collection quantity, and then replay the seed to collect data.

Please strictly follow our tutorial in [RoboTwin 2.0 Doc - Collect Data](https://robotwin-platform.github.io/doc/usage/collect-data.html).

```
bash collect_data.sh ${task_name} ${task_config} ${gpu_id}
# Example: bash collect_data.sh cover_blocks demo_clean 0
```
</details>

## 4. Run Policies

1. Mem-0 (ours): [See Mem-0 Document](./policy/Mem-0/README.md)
2. DP: [See DP Document](https://robotwin-platform.github.io/doc/usage/DP.html)
3. ACT: [See ACT Document](https://robotwin-platform.github.io/doc/usage/ACT.html)
4. Pi 0.5: [See Pi 0.5 Document](https://robotwin-platform.github.io/doc/usage/Pi05.html)
5. X-VLA: [See X-VLA Document](./policy/X-VLA/README.md)
6. Other Policies (Pi0, RDT, etc): [See Document](https://robotwin-platform.github.io/doc/usage) and [See Folder](./policy/)
6. **Configure your policy:** [See Tutorial Here](https://robotwin-platform.github.io/doc/usage/deploy-your-policy.html)
