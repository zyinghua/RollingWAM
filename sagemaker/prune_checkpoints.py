"""Keep the SageMaker checkpoint prefix small enough to restore.

Why this exists
---------------
SageMaker restores the ENTIRE ``checkpoint_s3_uri`` prefix into
/opt/ml/checkpoints *before* the container starts. Past some size that restore
fails outright, and the job dies with a completely opaque

    InternalServerError: We encountered an internal error. Please try again.

with ZERO CloudWatch log streams, because the container never ran. Measured on
the libero job (93 GB per checkpoint):

    92 GB  (1 checkpoint)   restore OK, container starts, auto-resume works
    369 GB (4 checkpoints)  InternalServerError, container never starts

The trainer has no retention policy, so any long run walks itself into this.

Policy
------
Newest checkpoint stays in ``checkpoint_s3_uri`` (small restore). The previous
one is MOVED to a sibling ``<prefix>-archive/`` — outside the restore path, so
it costs nothing at startup, but is still there if the newest turns out to have
been cut mid-write by a spot reclaim. Without that spare, a corrupt newest makes
auto-resume reject everything and silently restart from step 0.

Anything older than that is deleted. Local copies under /opt/ml/checkpoints are
removed too, otherwise SageMaker's sync just re-uploads what we pruned.

Runs as a forked daemon from entry.py (see ``spawn``), on the main host only.
Every failure is swallowed: pruning must never be able to kill training.
